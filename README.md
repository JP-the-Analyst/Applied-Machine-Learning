MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project focuses on training a neural network model to recognize and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels. The goal is to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies these digits.

Requirements
Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib

Usage
1. Preparing the Data
Download the MNIST dataset or provide your own dataset in a compatible format.
Preprocess the data using standard techniques such as normalization, resizing, or data augmentation.

2. Training the Model
Use the model.fit() method provided by TensorFlow/Keras to train the model.
Specify the number of epochs, batch size, and other training parameters as needed.

3. Evaluating the Model
Use the model.evaluate() method to evaluate the model on a test set.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc., to assess the model's performance.

4. Making Predictions
Explain how users can make predictions using the trained model. For example:

Use the model.predict() method to generate predictions for new data.
Visualize predictions using Matplotlib or other visualization tool.
